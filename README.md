# Volleyball Score Keeper

Ok, I lied. The project does not have CSS... It does have Bootstrap though lol.
I wanted to do this project as a fun way to create something that interests me (Volleyball + Anime: Haikyuu!).
AND it is my first project with JavaScript. I had a lot of fun learning how to interact with the page with DOMs; It really opens a new world of possibilities.
